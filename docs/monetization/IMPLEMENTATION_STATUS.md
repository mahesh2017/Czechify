# Implementation status

## Delivery 1 — Access-policy foundation

Implemented on `codex/monetization-research-plan`:

- Immutable campaign catalog with explicit A1/A2 membership, two free units and the ordered 15-unit reward list. Tests compare it with the actual bundled curriculum and pinned lesson manifest.
- Commercial access as a union of free, permanent referral/legacy, Core, migration grace and staff sources. Unknown unit grants and another account's snapshot cannot unlock content.
- Subscription state and offline validity policies, including exact expiry boundaries and aggregation that cannot mix one purchase's expiry with another purchase's verification date.
- Independent Core and AI feature models, immutable account-bound snapshots, and revision/replay checks.
- Structured lesson admission decisions and a two-hour existing-attempt permit bound to account, epoch, lesson and attempt.
- Deterministic referral preview with a two-milestone limit, permanent-ownership filtering, exact A1 reward order and explicit cap-reached outcomes. This is not a client reward-grant mechanism.
- Phase-local learning prerequisites: late A1 units no longer depend on A2 lessons. New explicit placement targets are phase-specific; existing scalar placements retain their previously open span through a compatibility adapter.
- Executable Dart tests for all 40 pure decision fixtures, additional boundary/security cases and curriculum/manifest drift. The three database concurrency fixtures deliberately remain for real database tests.

Validation passed:

- Full Flutter suite: 1,335 tests before the final additional manifest check.
- Final targeted suite with coverage: 85 tests, including that manifest check.
- Changed executable-line coverage: 159/162 lines (98.1%), measured from the staged source diff and LCOV output; above the project's 80% requirement.
- `flutter analyze --no-pub --fatal-infos` and `git diff --cached --check`.

## Delivery 2 — Entitlement backend, signed snapshots and phase placement

Implemented on the same branch; setup and security boundaries are in [BACKEND_SETUP.md](BACKEND_SETUP.md).

- Phase-specific placement persistence: `placement_profiles.phase_ceilings` (server) and the local Drift equivalent keep separate A1 and A2 ceilings. Old clients that write only the scalar `provisional_unit` keep their previously open span, and merges never discard either phase.
- Owner-read-only `monetization_accounts`, `course_unit_grants` and `course_access_windows`; private feature entitlements, audit and outbox. Service-only `set_course_unit_grant` and `apply_verified_feature` serialize on the account and write grant, revision, audit and outbox in one transaction. Neither verifies eligibility or a purchase itself; PR 3 and PR 4 workers must do that first.
- `monetization-api` Edge Function: `GET /configuration` (every activation switch false) and `GET /entitlements`, which derives the account from the verified JWT and returns an Ed25519 compact JWS.
- Dart `SnapshotVerifier` with an embedded key allowlist, and an account-scoped `MonetizationRepository` cache. Replayed or older documents cannot reset the offline clock; clock rollback requires reverification; account transitions suspend the repository so late replies cannot publish another account's access. An unreachable service (including a missing backend client) falls back to the verified cached document.
- Account export includes grant, window and feature history without internal source keys; account deletion removes the beneficiary's access.

Validation passed on the staged commit:

- Full Flutter suite: 1,355 tests. `flutter analyze --no-pub --fatal-infos` clean.
- Changed-line coverage against Delivery 1: 85% (495/577), measured with CI's `diff-cover` exclusions. CI's figure moves about half a point between identical runs.
- Database: `supabase db reset` applies the full migration chain from empty, and `supabase test db` passes 123/123 across all five pgTAP files, using the Supabase Postgres image with Docker Desktop. `supabase db lint --level warning` is clean.
- Edge Functions: `deno fmt --check`, `deno lint`, `deno check` and 49/49 `deno test`.

A plain `postgres:17` container with stubbed Auth and legacy tables passed the new tests but missed three failures the real chain exposed: `placement_profiles.device_id` is required, the account export now has 18 sections rather than 15, and the existing `keep_newest_sync_row` trigger discards updates whose `updated_at` does not advance. Treat only the full Supabase stack as verification for database changes.

Known limitations to resolve before activation:

- Content revision `25` is hard-coded in `get_monetization_snapshot` and in `SnapshotVerifier`. A content release must change both together, or clients reject every signed snapshot.
- `private.placement_unit_order` uses unit ID as `order_index`. This matches the current A1 order (1–15, 28, 30) but must become explicit if a unit is ever inserted out of numeric order.
- `keep_newest_sync_row` still discards an entire placement write whose `updated_at` is older than the stored row, so a phase ceiling from a device with an older timestamp is dropped rather than merged. This matches the pre-existing scalar behavior.
- The staging signing key, public-key distribution and a staging Supabase project have not been provisioned; nothing has been deployed.

## Delivery 3a — Server-side purchase verification

PR 3 is split into 3a (server verification), 3b (Play notifications and the retry worker) and 3c (Flutter checkout, restore and subscriptions screen). 3a is backend only.

- Private billing tables: products (seeded disabled), frozen per-account Play bindings, purchase intents, purchases with SHA-256 token digests and AES-GCM encrypted tokens, fenced verification/acknowledgement jobs and an audit log. A deleted owner leaves a tombstone that no other account can claim.
- Service-only RPCs for binding, intents, registration, job leases, applying a Play result, completing an acknowledgement, failing a job, owner-scoped status and an operator product switch. `apply_play_verification` rechecks the lease and the account binding, provisions through `apply_verified_feature`, and only then creates the acknowledgement job.
- `monetization-api` routes: `POST /purchase-intents`, `POST /purchases/verify` and `GET /purchases/status/<id>`, all requiring a linked account. Verification runs inline and returns `202 verification_pending` when Play is slow or failing. The purchase routes return `503` until all billing secrets are configured.
- A Play Developer API client (service-account OAuth, `subscriptionsv2.get`, `subscriptions.acknowledge`) and a pure normalizer that maps every documented `SubscriptionState` and refuses unknown ones instead of guessing.
- Contract change: `/purchases/verify` requires `product_id`, because Play's lookup is keyed by product.

Validation:

- Database: `supabase test db` passes 173/173 on the full migration chain, including 50 new billing checks for client isolation, frozen bindings, intent idempotency and rate limits, foreign and tombstoned tokens, fencing, binding mismatch, pending purchases, acknowledgement ordering and backoff.
- Edge Functions: `deno fmt --check`, `deno lint`, `deno check` and 76/76 `deno test`.
- End to end: `billing_integration_test.ts` drove the real handler, RPC wiring, Auth and database on the local stack with only Play faked. A linked account bought Core and was acknowledged; a second account and an anonymous account were refused.

Not in 3a: the background retry worker, Play notification intake and daily reconciliation (3b); the Flutter purchase flow (3c); the generic `operation_results` idempotency table (purchase verification is idempotent through the token digest, and intents through their own key); and real Play license tests, which need the staging setup in [BACKEND_SETUP.md](BACKEND_SETUP.md).

## Delivery 3b — Play notifications and the billing worker

- `play-billing-notifications` Edge Function: verifies Google's Pub/Sub OIDC token, parses the developer notification and records it once per message ID by token digest, then queues a Play refresh for a known purchase. Success is returned only after storage; unusable messages are acknowledged and logged.
- `monetization-worker` Edge Function, called every minute by a scheduler with a shared secret: queues reconciliation, runs due jobs with acknowledgements first within a 40-second budget, and reports `billing_health()` counts.
- Database: notification inbox; refresh queueing that brings a waiting job forward and queues one more behind a running one; reconciliation selection; due-job ordering; health counts. Jobs are marked dead after 80 attempts.
- Found and fixed while testing: reconciliation originally reused the notification path, which would have cancelled every backing-off job's delay on each one-minute run. Reconciliation now skips purchases with an open refresh; a regression test covers it.

Validation:

- Database: `supabase test db` passes 204/204 on the full migration chain, including 31 new notification and worker checks.
- Edge Functions: `deno fmt --check`, `deno lint`, `deno check` on all six entry points, and 90 unit tests. Push-token checks sign real RS256 tokens against a local key set and refuse the wrong issuer, audience, email, unverified email and a foreign signing key.
- End to end: the integration test now also sends a cancellation notification (plus its redelivery) through real intake and runs the real worker against the local stack. The worker re-read Play and recorded the cancellation, and Core access stayed active until the paid-through date.

Not in 3b: deploying the functions, the Pub/Sub topic and the scheduler; alert routing for `billing_attention_required`. See [BACKEND_SETUP.md](BACKEND_SETUP.md).

## Activation boundary

Only the phase-local progression correction is connected to the existing runtime. The entitlement repository and providers exist, but no screen, route or lesson admission reads them yet. Purchase verification exists on the server with its products disabled; there is no in-app checkout, production paywall, deployed migration or real referral grant. No production backend was changed.

Do not connect an unverified JSON/cache object to `MonetizationSnapshot`. The next backend/client repository work must verify the signed snapshot, account and protocol before these policies receive it. `ReferralRewardPolicy` is a preview; authoritative rewards require the locked database transaction and uniqueness constraints in the specification.

## Next implementation work

1. PR 3c: Flutter Store adapter, purchase and restore, and a minimal subscriptions screen behind the disabled flag. Real license tests need a staging Supabase project, Play Console subscription products with license testers, a Play Developer API service account and a notification topic.
2. Implement referral claim/evidence/Integrity/outbox and transactional allocation (PR 4), including the three database concurrency fixtures deferred from Delivery 1.
3. Course UI/admission, AI authorization/cost controls, existing-user migration and rollout (PRs 5–8).
